# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

Given an array where the *i*-th element represents the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to calculate the maximum profit you can achieve. You can complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

* Example 1:
  * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  * Output: 7
  Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

* Example 2:
  * Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  * Output: 4
  Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and then sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

* Example 3:
  * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
  * Output: 0
  Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done and the maximum profit is 0.

Constraints:
* 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10^4
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

## Approach

We've explained this problem in the greedy algorithm section before: [Greedy Algorithm: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0122.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii.html), but this time we will delve into the dynamic programming solution in detail.

The only difference here compared to [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html) is that in this problem, you are allowed to buy and sell the stock multiple times (note that you can only hold one stock at a time, so you must sell before buying again).

In terms of the dynamic programming approach, the main distinction between this problem and [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html) lies in the recurrence relation, while other aspects remain the same.

Let's focus on the transition formulas in this explanation.

First, let's clarify the meaning of the dp array:
* `dp[i][0]` represents the maximum cash after holding the stock on day *i*.
* `dp[i][1]` represents the maximum cash after not holding the stock on day *i*.

If you hold the stock on day *i*, i.e., `dp[i][0]`, it can be deduced from two states:
* Holding the stock from day *i-1*, keeping the status quo, so the cash remains the same as yesterday's held stock cash, i.e., `dp[i - 1][0]`.
* Buying the stock on day *i*, the cash is yesterday's non-holding stock cash minus today's stock price, i.e., `dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]`.

**Note that the only difference from [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html) is when deriving `dp[i][0]`, where buying stock on day *i* is considered.**

In [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html), since the stock can only be bought and sold once, if you buy the stock, `dp[i][0]` will definitely be `-prices[i]`.

However, in this problem, as the stock can be bought and sold multiple times, when buying on day *i*, there might be profits from previous transactions.

Thus, if you buy the stock on day *i*, `dp[i][0]` would be `dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]`.

Similarly, if you do not hold a stock on day *i*, i.e., `dp[i][1]`, it can be deduced from two states as well:
* Not holding the stock from day *i-1*, keeping things as they are, so the cash remains the same as yesterday's non-holding stock cash, i.e., `dp[i - 1][1]`.
* Selling the stock on day *i*, the cash obtained is today's stock price plus yesterday's cash from holding the stock, i.e., `prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0]`.

**Note this aligns perfectly with [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html) in logic, as selling stocks to gain profit is completely logical!**

Code is as follows (note the annotation in the code highlighting the only difference from 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock):

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int len = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(len, vector<int>(2, 0));
        dp[0][0] -= prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]); // Note this is the only difference from 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock.
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[len - 1][1];
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

You can see that the code for this problem is almost the same as [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0121.best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.html), with only one key difference:

```
dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]);
```

**This is exactly because in this problem, stocks can be traded multiple times!** Therefore, when buying stocks, there may be previous trading profits, i.e., `dp[i - 1][1]`, so `dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i]`.

If you understand this, you have a deeper understanding of these two problems.

Here I also provide a version using the rolling array, as shown in the C++ code below:

```CPP
// Version 2
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int len = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(2)); // Note that only a 2 * 2 sized 2D array is allocated here
        dp[0][0] -= prices[0];
        dp[0][1] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            dp[i % 2][0] = max(dp[(i - 1) % 2][0], dp[(i - 1) % 2][1] - prices[i]);
            dp[i % 2][1] = max(dp[(i - 1) % 2][1], prices[i] + dp[(i - 1) % 2][0]);
        }
        return dp[(len - 1) % 2][1];
    }
};
```

- Space Complexity: O(1)
