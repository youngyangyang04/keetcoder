# 509. Fibonacci Number

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence called the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. That is:
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), where n > 1
Given n, calculate F(n).

Example 1:
* Input: 2
* Output: 1
* Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1

Example 2:
* Input: 3
* Output: 2
* Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2

Example 3:
* Input: 4
* Output: 3
* Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3

Constraints:

* 0 <= n <= 30

## Thought Process

The Fibonacci sequence should be very familiar to most. It's a great introductory problem for practicing dynamic programming.

Because this problem is quite simple, some might not even need any analysis and can just write the solution directly.

**However, the style of "Code Thought Record" is: Simple problems are meant to deepen the understanding of solving methodologies.**

This problem allows you to initially see how the dynamic programming five-step process is used to solve problems.

Without a methodology, you might be able to immediately solve simple problems, but a slightly more complicated one leaves you at a loss.

So the dynamic programming five-step process I summarize is to be used throughout the entire dynamic programming series, just like the [Recursive Three-Step Process for Binary Trees](https://keetcoder.com/problems/binary-tree-recursive-traversal.html) and the [Backtracking Three-Step Process for Backtracking Algorithm](https://keetcoder.com/problems/backtracking-algorithm-fundamentals.html). Over time, you will realize how important the dynamic programming five-step process is.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming five-step process:

Here, we need a one-dimensional dp array to save the results of the recursion.

1. Determine the dp array and the meaning of the indices

The definition of dp[i] is: The Fibonacci number at position i is dp[i].

2. Determine the recurrence relation

Why is this problem considered a simple introductory question?

**Because the problem gives us the recurrence relation directly: The state transition equation dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];**

3. How to initialize the dp array

**The problem also directly tells us how to initialize it:**

```
dp[0] = 0;
dp[1] = 1;
```

4. Determine the order of traversal

From the recursion formula dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; we can see that dp[i] relies on dp[i - 1] and dp[i - 2], so the order of traversal must be from front to back.

5. Example to derive the dp array

According to this recurrence relation dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2], when N is 10, the dp array should be as follows:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

If the code doesn't produce the correct result, print out the dp array to see if it matches the derived sequence.

Having analyzed the problem using dynamic programming, here is the C++ code:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int N) {
        if (N <= 1) return N;
        vector<int> dp(N + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[N];
    }
};
```
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

You may notice that we only need to maintain two numbers without recording the entire sequence.

Here's the code:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int N) {
        if (N <= 1) return N;
        int dp[2];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i++) {
            int sum = dp[0] + dp[1];
            dp[0] = dp[1];
            dp[1] = sum;
        }
        return dp[1];
    }
};
```

* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

### Recursive Solution

This problem can also be solved using a recursive solution.

Here's the code:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int N) {
        if (N < 2) return N;
        return fib(N - 1) + fib(N - 2);
    }
};
```

* Time Complexity: O(2^n)
* Space Complexity: O(n), considering the stack space used by the system for recursion

The time complexity for this recursive approach can be understood by drawing a tree diagram. If it's unclear, please refer to this article: [Explain Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithms with an Interview Problem!](https://keetcoder.com/problems/dynamic-programming-fundamentals.html)

## Summary

The Fibonacci sequence is a fundamental problem in dynamic programming and will be mentioned multiple times throughout the discussion of this topic!

In this explanation, I strictly followed the dynamic programming five-step process outlined in the [Dynamic Programming Fundamentals](https://keetcoder.com/problems/dynamic-programming-fundamentals.html). Some might find these analysis steps unnecessarily complicated and might code directly right away.

However, let me emphasize again: Simple problems are used to master methodologies. The dynamic programming five-step process will be important in discussions of dynamic programming problems that follow, so stay tuned!

Thatâ€™s it, learn algorithms step by step with "Code Thought Record"!

func fib(n int) int {
    if n < 2 {
        return n
    }
    a, b, c := 0, 1, 0
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {

    let pre1 = 1
    let pre2 = 0
    let temp
    if (n === 0) return 0
    if (n === 1) return 1
    for(let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {

### C

```c
int fib(int n){
    // When n <= 1, return n
    if(n <= 1)
        return n;
    // Dynamically allocate an int array of size n+1
    int *dp = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * (n + 1));
    // Set the 0th index to 0, 1st index to 1
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;

    // Traverse the array from front to back (i=2; i <= n; ++i), the element at index n is dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    int i;
    for(i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

Recursive Approach:
```c
int fib(int n){
    // If n is less than or equal to 1, return n
    if(n <= 1)
        return n;
    // Otherwise, return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```
