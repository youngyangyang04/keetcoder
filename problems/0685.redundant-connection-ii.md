# 685. Redundant Connection II

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/)

In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph that satisfies the following conditions. The tree has only one root node, and all other nodes are successors of that root node. Every node except the root node has exactly one parent, while the root node has no parent.

Input a directed graph that consists of a tree with n nodes (node values are unique and range from 1 to n) and an additional directed edge. The additional edge consists of two different vertices within the range of 1 to n, and this additional edge is not part of the tree's existing edges.

The result graph is a 2D-array `edges`, where each element is a pair `[ui, vi]`, indicating a directed edge from vertex `ui` to vertex `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of `vi`.

Return a removable edge such that the remaining graph is a rooted tree with n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that appears last in the given 2D-array.

Constraints:

* n == edges.length
* 3 <= n <= 1000
* edges[i].length == 2
* 1 <= ui, vi <= n

## Approach

First, focus on understanding this sentence in the problem: **The graph consists of a tree with N nodes (nodes are uniquely numbered from 1 to N), and an additional edge. The endpoints of this additional edge are within the range of 1 to N, and this edge is not already present in the tree.**

**This implies that the graph in question was originally a tree, but with an additional edge added without increasing the number of nodes!**

Also, **if there are multiple solutions, return the one that appears last in the provided 2D-array.** This implies that if there are two edges both of which can be removed to form a tree, the last one in sequence should be removed!

There are the following three cases. The first two involve a node with an in-degree of 2, as shown below:

<img src='https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/685.冗余连接II1.png' width=600> </img></div>

There is only one node with an in-degree of 2. Why not consider the out-degree? Out-degrees are irrelevant because any parent node in a tree naturally has multiple children.

The third case is when there is no node with an in-degree of 2, which means there must be a directed cycle in the graph (**note it's a directed cycle!**)

Here's the representation:

<img src='https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/685.冗余连接II2.png' width=600> </img></div>

First, calculate the in-degree of each node. Many often get confused when calculating the in-degree, unclear what `edges[i][j]` represents.

For example, if the given input is: `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`

One might naturally think of the array as being: `edges[1][2]`, `edges[1][3]`, `edges[2][3]`, but then wonder what the values of `edges[1][2]` actually mean. The more they think, the more confused they become.

In fact, `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`, means:

`edges[0][0] = 1`, `edges[0][1] = 2`, 

`edges[1][0] = 1`, `edges[1][1] = 3`, 

`edges[2][0] = 2`, `edges[2][1] = 3`.

2D arrays are something everyone learns, but when combined with graphs, it can be easy to mix up what are values and what are indices.

Once that's clear, how do we calculate the in-degree?

That is `edges[i][1]` denotes the node pointed to by an edge, indicating this node has an in-degree of one! (If you wanted to calculate the out-degree, it would be `edges[i][0]`).

The code to calculate in-degrees is as follows:

```cpp
int inDegree[N] = {0}; // Record the in-degrees of nodes
n = edges.size(); // Number of edges
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    inDegree[edges[i][1]]++; // Calculate in-degree
}
```

For the first two cases with a node having an in-degree of 2, it must be one of the two edges pointing to this node that needs to be removed. If removing one makes the graph a tree, then that edge is the answer. Also, we iterate from back to front so that if two edges can both be removed, we remove the last one.

Here's the code:

```cpp
vector<int> vec; // Store edges ending in a node with in-degree 2 (there will be two if this case occurs)
// Identify edges corresponding to nodes with in-degree 2, note the iteration is reverse due to return order of result
for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (inDegree[edges[i][1]] == 2) {
        vec.push_back(i);
    }
}
// Handle cases 1 and 2
// If a node with in-degree 2 exists, one of its edges needs to be deleted to form a tree
if (vec.size() > 0) {
    if (isTreeAfterRemoveEdge(edges, vec[0])) {
        return edges[vec[0]];
    } else {
        return edges[vec[1]];
    }
}
```

In case three, when there are no nodes with an in-degree of 2, there must be a directed cycle in the graph. Identify the edge forming the cycle which should be removed.

The code below defines this function:

```cpp
// Find and remove the edge such that the graph becomes a tree; the return value is the edge to be removed
vector<int> getRemoveEdge(const vector<vector<int>>& edges)
```

You will then understand that we need to implement two critical functions:

* `isTreeAfterRemoveEdge()` which tests if removing one edge results in a tree.
* `getRemoveEdge` which assures there's a directed cycle in the graph and identifies the edge to be removed.

Now the **union-find** data structure comes into play. Why can union-find determine if a graph is a tree?

**If the root of two vertices' edges can both be found in the union-find structure before adding any new edge, then this edge addition will ensure the graph is not a tree.**

If you're not familiar with union-find, check [Union-Find Theory Basics](https://keetcoder.com/problems/graph-union-find-theory-basics.html).
