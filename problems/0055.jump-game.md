# 55. Jump Game

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

You are given a non-negative integer array and you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you can reach the last index.

Example 1:

- Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
- Output: true
- Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:

- Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
- Output: false
- Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, so you can't reach the last index.

## Approach

When first looking at this problem, you might want to think: If the current element is 3, should I jump 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps? Which is the best way to jump? 

The number of steps doesn't matter; the key is the range of coverage that you can jump!

You don't need to clearly decide how many steps to jump each time. Just go for the maximum jump length, which is the range you can cover.

Within this range, no matter how you jump, you are guaranteed to be able to jump.

**So the problem transforms into checking whether the jump coverage range can reach the endpoint!**

Each time you move, take the maximum jumping step (achieve the maximum coverage range). Each time you move one unit forward, update the maximum coverage range.

**Greedy algorithm local optimal solution: take the maximum jumping step each time (choose maximum coverage range); overall optimal solution: eventually achieve the overall maximum coverage range to check if it can reach the endpoint.**

Local optimum leads to global optimum, and there's no counterexample. Try using a greedy approach!

Illustration:

![](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20230203105634.png)

The index `i` only moves within the range of `cover`. With each move, the range `cover` is updated with the value at that index, which supplements the new coverage range, allowing `i` to continue moving forward.

And `cover` always takes the maximum between the range supplemented by the current element’s value and the range `cover` itself.

If `cover` is greater than or equal to the index of the endpoint, return true.

C++ code is as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cover = 0;
        if (nums.size() == 1) return true; // If there's only one element, you can reach the end
        for (int i = 0; i <= cover; i++) { // Note that this is less than or equal to cover
            cover = max(i + nums[i], cover);
            if (cover >= nums.size() - 1) return true; // Indicates that it can cover the endpoint
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Conclusion

The key to this problem is: Don't be fixated on how many steps should be jumped each time. Instead, pay attention to the coverage range. Within the coverage range, you can definitely jump over, no matter how you jump.

You can see that the thought process is clear, and the code is straightforward once the strategy is figured out.

Some of you might feel that as I explain the greedy series, there's seemingly no connection between different problems?

**There's really no clear pattern because greedy algorithms don't have a common formula!** There's no overall framework for greedy approaches applicable to solve a series of problems. It’s about being exposed to various types of problems to enhance your understanding of greedy strategies!

        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        // Coverage range, initially should be 0 since iteration starts from index 0
        int coverRange = 0;
        // Update maximum coverage range within the current range
        for (int i = 0; i <= coverRange; i++) {
            coverRange = Math.max(coverRange, i + nums[i]);
