# 72. Edit Distance

[LeetCode problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

Given two words `word1` and `word2`, calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You can perform the following operations on a word:

* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

* Example 1:
* Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
* Output: 3
* Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

* Example 2:
* Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
* Output: 5
* Explanation:
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

Constraints:

* 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
* word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters

## Approach

The edit distance problem has finally arrived, and this problem can seem extremely complex without an understanding of dynamic programming.

Edit distance is a classic problem solved using dynamic programming. Though this problem looks complex at first, dynamic programming elegantly computes the minimal edit distance.

Here I'll analyze this problem thoroughly using the five steps of dynamic programming:

### 1. Define the dp array (dp table) and the meaning of the indices

**`dp[i][j]` indicates the minimum edit distance between the substring of `word1` ending at index `i-1` and the substring of `word2` ending at index `j-1`.**

Some might ask why this indicates the substring ending at `i-1` rather than `i`. 

The reason for defining it this way is explained in detail in [0718.Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0718.maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray.html).

You could use `i`! Opting for `i-1` simplifies subsequent initialization of the dp array.

### 2. Determine the recurrence formula

When determining the recurrence formula, first consider all possible editing operations, summarized below:

```
if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])
    No operation
if (word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1])
    Insert
    Delete
    Replace
```

These are the four cases.

`if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])` indicates no editing is needed, so `dp[i][j]` should equal `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, i.e., `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];`.

Some may not understand right away why `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]`.

Recall the definition of `dp[i][j]`. If `word1[i - 1]` equals `word2[j - 1]`, no editing is needed, and the minimum edit distance between the substring of `word1` ending at `i-2` and the substring of `word2` ending at `j-2`, which is `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, is `dp[i][j]`.

If some explanations are unclear, referring back to the definition of `dp[i][j]` can clarify it.

**The key to successfully applying dynamic programming here is a correct understanding of the definition of `dp[i][j]`.**

`if (word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1])`, editing is necessary. How can you edit it?

* Operation 1: Deleting a character from `word1` makes it align with a substring of `word2` up to `j-2`, requiring an additional operation. Thus, `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1;`.

* Operation 2: Deleting a character from `word2` aligns it with a substring of `word1` up to `i-2`, also requiring an additional operation, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1;`.

Some might notice these are deletion operations, what about insertion?

**Inserting a character in `word2` is equivalent to deleting a character in `word1`.** For instance, `word1 = "ad"`, `word2 = "a"`. Removing 'd' in `word1` to transform it into `a` and adding 'd' to `word2` to transform it into `ad` are essentially requiring the same number of operations! The dp array is illustrated as follows:

```
            a                         a     d
   +-----+-----+             +-----+-----+-----+
   |  0  |  1  |             |  0  |  1  |  2  |
   +-----+-----+   ===>      +-----+-----+-----+
 a |  1  |  0  |           a |  1  |  0  |  1  |
   +-----+-----+             +-----+-----+-----+
 d |  2  |  1  |
   +-----+-----+
```

Operation 3: Substituting a character: replace `word1[i - 1]` to match `word2[j - 1]` with no need for insertion or deletion. 

You only need one substitution operation to make `word1[i - 1]` and `word2[j - 1]` identical. Hence, `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;`.

In summary, when `if (word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1])`, take the minimum of these: `dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]}) + 1;`.

The recursion formula in code:

```CPP
if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
}
else {
    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]}) + 1;
}
```

---

### 3. Initialization of the dp array

Revisiting the definition of `dp[i][j]`:

**`dp[i][j]` indicates the minimum edit distance between the substring ending at `i-1` in `word1` and `j-1` in `word2`.**

What do `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` indicate?

`dp[i][0]`: indicates the minimum edit distance between the substring of `word1` ending at `i-1` and an empty string `word2`.

Thus, `dp[i][0]` should be `i`, as you would need to delete all characters in `word1`, i.e., `dp[i][0] = i;`.

Similarly, `dp[0][j] = j;`.

So the C++ code:

```CPP
for (int i = 0; i <= word1.size(); i++) dp[i][0] = i;
for (int j = 0; j <= word2.size(); j++) dp[0][j] = j;
```

### 4. Determine the order of traversal

In these recurrence formulas:

* `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]`
* `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`
* `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1`
* `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1`

It is evident that `dp[i][j]` relies on the values to its left, above, and diagonally above-left, as shown:

![72. Edit Distance](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210114162113131.jpg)

Thus, the dp matrix must be traversed from left to right and top to bottom.

The code:

```CPP
for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); j++) {
        if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
        else {
            dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]}) + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Demonstrate and Verify the dp array

Taking example 1, input: `word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"`, the dp matrix state is:

![72. Edit Distance 1](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210114162132300.jpg)

With this, the dynamic programming analysis is complete. Here's the C++ code:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(word1.size() + 1, vector<int>(word2.size() + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i <= word1.size(); i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 0; j <= word2.size(); j++) dp[0][j] = j;
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]}) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[word1.size()][word2.size()];
    }
};
```

* Space complexity: O(n * m)
