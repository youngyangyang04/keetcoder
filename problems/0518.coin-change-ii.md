# 518. Coin Change II

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)

Given different denominations of coins and a total amount of money. Write a function to calculate the number of combinations of coins that make up the total amount. Assume that each kind of coin has an infinite number.

Example 1:

* Input: amount = 5, coins = \[1, 2, 5\]
* Output: 4

Explanation: There are four ways to make up the amount:

* 5=5
* 5=2+2+1
* 5=2+1+1+1
* 5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:

* Input: amount = 3, coins = \[2\]
* Output: 0
* Explanation: Only coins of denomination 2 cannot make up the amount 3.

Example 3:

* Input: amount = 10, coins = \[10\]
* Output: 1

Notice that:

* 0 <= amount <= 5000
* 1 <= coin <= 5000
* The number of coin types does not exceed 500
* The result fits within a 32-bit signed integer

## Two-dimensional DP Explanation

If everyone has completed: [Knapsack Theory 01 Knapsack-1](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-theory-01-knapsack-1.html), [Last Stone Weight II](https://www.programmercarl.com/1049.%E6%9C%80%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%80%E5%9D%97%E7%9F%B3%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%84%E9%87%8D%E9%87%8FII.html) and [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html)

You should know similar problems: providing a total, some items, asking if this total can be achieved.

This is a typical knapsack problem!

In this case, the task is to find out how many combinations of items can fill the knapsack with a certain total amount.

Since each kind of coin is infinite, this is a complete knapsack problem.

For those unfamiliar with the complete knapsack, check out: [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html)

However, this problem is different from a pure complete knapsack, as the pure complete knapsack asks for the highest value expected to fill the knapsack, whereas this problem asks for the number of combinations of items that total to a given amount!

Notice how the problem description talks about the number of combinations of coins. Why highlight combinations?

For example, in sample one:

5 = 2 + 2 + 1

5 = 2 + 1 + 2

This counts as one combination, both are 2 2 1.

If asked for permutations, then the above would be two different permutations.

**Combinations do not emphasize the order among elements, while permutations do.** This concept was also discussed during the backtracking algorithm topic.

Why bring this up? Because it is closely related to the traversal sequence explained below!

This problem is actually quite similar to [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html).

[0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html) asks how many ways to fill the knapsack, and this problem asks for the number of combinations. 

What's the difference? 

**Finding how many ways to fill the knapsack is essentially asking for the number of combinations.** However, [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html) is a 0/1 knapsack, where each type of item only has one piece. 

Now let's dive into the following five dynamic programming steps:

### 1. Define the DP Array and the Meaning of Each Index

Define the two-dimensional DP array `dp[i][j]`: Using coins with indices [0, i], there are `dp[i][j]` combinations to fill a knapsack of size j.

Many might wonder, why start with defining the DP array, what is the thought process? This thought process is detailed in [Knapsack Theory 01 Knapsack-1](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-theory-01-knapsack-1.html) under "Define the DP array and the meaning of each index."

(**It is strongly recommended to follow the study order of the programming routine, otherwise, you may not understand the explanation**)

### 2. Determine the Recurrence Relation

> **Note**: The formula derivation here is largely repetitive with [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html) and [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html), so the principles won't be repeated, only the differences are explained.

Revisiting [Knapsack Theory 01 Knapsack-1](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-theory-01-knapsack-1.html), the two-dimensional DP array recurrence relation is: 

`dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - weight[i]] + value[i])`

In [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html), the complete knapsack two-dimensional DP array recurrence relation was detailed as: 

`dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - weight[i]] + value[i])`

What is the distinction between a complete knapsack and a 0/1 knapsack? 

It lies in that the 0/1 knapsack uses `dp[i - 1][j - weight[i]] + value[i]`, while the complete knapsack uses `dp[i][j - weight[i]] + value[i]`.

The primary reason is that a complete knapsack allows an infinite quantity of each type of item.

The specifics are explained in [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html). If you've forgotten, do revisit.

I've mentioned before that this problem is the same as [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html), the only difference being that [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html) is a 0/1 knapsack, while this is a complete knapsack.

In [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html), the analysis of how many ways to fill the knapsack, the two-dimensional DP array recurrence relation is: 
`dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]]`

Therefore, in this problem, the recurrence relation is: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - nums[i]]`, the distinction being between `dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]]` and `dp[i][j - nums[i]]`.

The ‘therefore’ here omits much of the derivation content, as these contents have been detailed in [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html) and [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html).

Here it is not repeated.

The major points of confusion include:

1. How the recurrence formula `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - nums[i]]` came about is elaborated in [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html).

2. Why is it `dp[i][j - nums[i]]` and not `dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]]`, as in [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html).

### 3. How to Initialize the DP Array

Here, the top row and leftmost column of the two-dimensional array must be initialized. This is the foundation for the recurrence relation derivation, indicated by the red parts in the diagram.

![Knapsack with infinity items](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20240827103507.png)

The first focus should be, what's the value of `dp[0][0]`?

The knapsack space being 0 means the number of combinations with "item 0" is how many? 

It should be 0, but if "item 0" had a value of zero, wouldn't it mean unlimited 0 combinations equal to 0! 

Luckily, the problem description states `1 <= coins.length <= 300`, so you don't need to worry about item value zero.

How should the top row `dp[0][j]` be initialized? 

The meaning of `dp[0][j]`: The number of combinations to fill the knapsack of size j using "item 0" (that is, `coins[0]`). (If the DP array's meaning is unclear, consider first studying [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html))

If j is divisible by item 0, there's one combination to fill it.

Initialization code:

```cpp
for (int j = 0; j <= bagSize; j++) {
    if (j % coins[0] == 0) dp[0][j] = 1;
}
```

How is the left column initialized?

The meaning of `dp[i][0]`: The number of combinations to fill a knapsack of capacity 0 with item i (that is, `coins[i]`).

There is always one way, which is to not pack anything.

So all `dp[i][0]` are initialized to 1.

### 4. Determine the Traversal Order

In the two-dimensional DP array's complete knapsack, the order of the two for loops can be either. 

Whether to iterate over the knapsack first or the items first, both are fine.

The reason is the same as in [Knapsack Theory 01 Knapsack-1](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-theory-01-knapsack-1.html) under "Traversal Order."

### 5. Print the DP Array

Take, for example, amount = 5, coins = \[2, 3, 5\]: 

The dp array should be like this:

```
1 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 2
```

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        int bagSize = amount;

        vector<vector<uint64_t>> dp(coins.size(), vector<uint64_t>(bagSize + 1, 0));

        // Initialize the top row
        for (int j = 0; j <= bagSize; j++) {
            if (j % coins[0] == 0) dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        // Initialize the left column
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        // The order of the subsequent traversal of rows and columns can be reversed
        for (int i = 1; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Row, iterate through items
            for (int j = 0; j <= bagSize; j++) { // Column, iterate through the knapsack
                if (coins[i] > j) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; 
                else dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] +  dp[i][j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[coins.size() - 1][bagSize];
    }
};
```

## One-dimensional DP Explanation 

### 1. Define the DP Array and the Meaning of Each Index

`dp[j]`: The number of combinations for achieving the total amount j is `dp[j]`.

### 2. Determine the Recurrence Relation

The two-dimensional dp recurrence formula for this problem: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] +  dp[i][j - coins[i]]` 

Compressing it to one dimension: `dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]]` 

This recurrence formula should be familiar, as it was explained when discussing 0/1 knapsack problems in [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html), which involve finding how many ways there are to fill the knapsack, encapsulating the formula: `dp[j] += dp[j - nums[i]]`

### 3. How to Initialize the DP Array 

The method to fill a knapsack with a capacity of 0 is 1, which is to pack nothing, so `dp[0] = 1`.

### 4. Determine the Traversal Order

In this problem, do we use an outer for-loop to iterate over items (coins) and an inner for-loop to iterate over the knapsack (total amount), or the other way around?

In [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html), it's shown that either order is fine in a complete knapsack.

**But here, that's not the case!**

Because a pure complete knapsack asks how much must be filled, regardless of the order of the elements, whether ordered or not!

This problem, however, requires counting the number of combinations, where element order specifically isn't emphasized.

So while a pure complete knapsack can determine if it's possible to achieve without worrying about how, this problem requires counting the number of possible arrangements, and each is considered a combination.

In this problem, the order of the two for-loops does matter.

Let’s first see what happens when the outer loop iterates through items (coins) and the inner loop iterates through the knapsack (total amount).

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Iterate through items
    for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) { // Iterate through knapsack capacity
        dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
    }
}
```

Suppose: `coins[0] = 1`, `coins[1] = 5`.

Here, by first including 1 in the calculation and then including 5, we only calculate combinations like {1, 5}. Combinations like {5, 1} are not included.

**Thus, in this traversal order, what's calculated in `dp[j]` are combinations!**

If the two for-loops are reversed, the code would be:

```cpp
for (int j = 0; j <= amount; j++) { // Iterate through knapsack capacity
    for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Iterate through items
        if (j - coins[i] >= 0) dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
    }
}
```

In this case, each value of knapsack capacity is calculated through both 1 and 5, including both {1, 5} and {5, 1} situations.

**Now what's calculated in `dp[j]` are permutations!**

Some may still not be fully understanding this; **it's recommended to manually print out the value changes in the dp array for these two approaches and compare them (practice makes perfect)!**

### 5. Example Analysis of the DP Array

Input: amount = 5, coins = \[1, 2, 5\], the state of the dp array is shown below:

![518. Coin Change II](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210120181331461.jpg)

Finally, the result is the value in the red box, `dp[amount]`.

Now, the full C++ code is as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<uint64_t> dp(amount + 1, 0); // Prevent integer overflow
        dp[0] = 1; // Only one way to make up 0
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Iterate through items
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) { // Iterate through knapsack
                dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount]; // Return the count of combinations
    }
};
```

Some C++ test cases involve adding two numbers that exceed int, so it's necessary to add `if (dp[i] < INT_MAX - dp[i - num])` in there.

* **Time Complexity**: O(mn), where m is amount and n is the length of coins
* **Space Complexity**: O(m)

To prevent addition data from exceeding int, you can also write:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // Only one way to make up 0
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Iterate through items
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) { // Iterate through knapsack
                if (dp[j] < INT_MAX - dp[j - coins[i]]) { // Prevent integer overflow
                    dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount]; // Return the count of combinations
    }
};
```

## Summary

We analyzed from two-dimensional to one-dimensional in this question.

For beginners, it's easier to understand starting from two-dimensional.

Later, I recommend directly mastering the one-dimensional approach, as it's easier to implement once proficient.

In this question, two-dimensional dp mainly requires understanding its relation and difference with the topics [Knapsack Theory 01 Knapsack-1](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-theory-01-knapsack-1.html), [0494.Target Sum](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0494.target-sum.html), and [Knapsack Problem Theory Basics Complete Knapsack](https://keetcoder.com/problems/knapsack-problem-theory-basics-complete-knapsack.html).

This is the essence of the coding practice's problem-solving sequence.

In the one-dimensional dp of this question, the difficulty lies in understanding the iteration order.

**When asking for the number of ways to fill the knapsack, recognizing the loop order is crucial.**

**If asking for combinations, then iterate over items with the outer loop and iterate over the knapsack with the inner loop.**

**If asking for permutations, then iterate over the knapsack with the outer loop and iterate over the items with the inner loop.**

Some may be puzzled by permutations, but more problems that ask for permutations will be arranged later. When compared, the mystery will become apparent!
