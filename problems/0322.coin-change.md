# 322. Coin Change

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

Given different denominations of coins and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that are needed to make up that amount. If that amount cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:
* Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
* Output: 3
* Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:
* Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
* Output: -1

Example 3:
* Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
* Output: 0

Example 4:
* Input: coins = [1], amount = 1
* Output: 1

Example 5:
* Input: coins = [1], amount = 2
* Output: 2

Constraints:

* 1 <= coins.length <= 12
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
* 0 <= amount <= 10^4

## Approach

We have exchanged coins once in [Dynamic Programming: 0518.Coin Change II](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0518.coin-change-ii.html) and now we are exchanging them again, but with a different approach!

The problem states that the quantity of each coin is infinite, indicating a classic complete knapsack problem.

Dynamic Programming approach:

1. Define the dp array and its meaning:

**dp[j]: The minimum number of coins needed to make up the total amount j is dp[j]**

2. Determine the transition equation:

The minimum number of coins needed to make up the total amount j - coins[i] is dp[j - coins[i]], so just adding one coin coins[i] would make it dp[j - coins[i]] + 1 (considering coins[i]).

Thus, dp[j] should take the minimum from all dp[j - coins[i]] + 1.

Transition equation: `dp[j] = min(dp[j - coins[i]] + 1, dp[j]);`

3. Initialize the dp array:

First, the minimum number of coins needed to make up a total amount of 0 is definitely 0, thus dp[0] = 0;

What about other indices?

Considering the nature of the transition equation, the dp[j] must be initialized to a large value, otherwise, it will be overwritten by the initial value during the min comparison.

Thus, all non-zero indices should be initialized to the maximum value.

The code is as follows:

```cpp
vector<int> dp(amount + 1, INT_MAX);
dp[0] = 0;
```

4. Determine the order of traversal:

This problem asks for the minimum number of coins, so the sequence of coins matters or not does not affect the minimum number of coins.

So this problem does not emphasize whether the set is a combination or permutation.

**If it's a combination, iterate over items with the outer loop, and over the knapsack with the inner loop.**

**If it's a permutation, iterate over the knapsack with the outer loop and over items with the inner loop.**

In the dynamic programming topic, we talked about how to find combinations in [Dynamic Programming: 0518.Coin Change II](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0518.coin-change-ii.html), and how to find permutations in [Dynamic Programming: 0377.Combination Sum IV](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0377.combination-sum-iv.html).

**In this question, the two-for-loop relationship is: iterate over the items with the outer loop and the target with the inner loop, or iterate over the target with the outer loop and the items with the inner loop, both are feasible!**

Therefore, I will use the coins in the outer loop, and the target in the inner loop.

Since the number of coins can be used infinitely, this is a complete knapsack problem, and the inner loop should proceed in the forward direction.

Thus, the order of traversal is: coins (items) are in the outer loop, target (knapsack) is in the inner loop, and the inner loop is in forward order.

5. Derive the dp array using an example:

For input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 5

![322.Coin Change](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210201111833906.jpg)

dp[amount] is the final result.

The above analysis is complete, and the C++ code is as follows:

```cpp
// Version 1
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.size(); i++) { // Iterate through items
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) { // Iterate through knapsack
                if (dp[j - coins[i]] != INT_MAX) { // If dp[j - coins[i]] is the initial value, skip it
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j - coins[i]] + 1, dp[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        if (dp[amount] == INT_MAX) return -1;
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```

* Time complexity: O(n * amount), where n is the length of coins
* Space complexity: O(amount)

For the traversal method of putting the knapsack in the outer loop and the items in the inner loop is also feasible, I will directly provide the code.

```cpp
// Version 2
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {  // Iterate through the knapsack
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.size(); j++) { // Iterate through items
                if (i - coins[j] >= 0 && dp[i - coins[j]] != INT_MAX ) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i - coins[j]] + 1, dp[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        if (dp[amount] == INT_MAX) return -1;
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```
* Same as above

## Summary

Attentive students who look at solutions online might find that one explanation puts the loop iterating over the knapsack on the outside and another puts it on the inside, and after seeing a lot, you might get confused about the order of these two loops.

There's barely an article that clarifies the order!

This is also the frustration faced by most students learning dynamic programming. Sometimes the transition equation is simple; the difficulty lies in the order of traversal!

But in the end, problems can be solved in a confusing way with no clear understanding of why they work; they just do.

This article clearly explains the traversal order for you.

In [Dynamic Programming: 0518.Coin Change II](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0518.coin-change-ii.html), we seek combinations, and in [Dynamic Programming: 0377.Combination Sum IV](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0377.combination-sum-iv.html), we seek permutations.

**And this problem asks for the minimum number of coins, whether they are combinations or permutations does not matter! So either order of the two for loops is acceptable!**

That's why I talked about 518.Coin Change II before this problem, which is: 322.Coin Change, with good reason.

I believe after reading it, you have a better understanding of the traversal order in knapsack problems.

### Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        // Initialize dp array to maximum value
        for (int j = 0; j < dp.length; j++) {
            dp[j] = max;
        }
        // When the amount is 0, the number of coins needed is 0
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
            // Forward traversal: Complete knapsack can select each coin multiple times
            for (int j = coins[i]; j <= amount; j++) {
                // Only when dp[j - coins[i]] is not the initial maximum value, this position needs to be chosen
                if (dp[j - coins[i]] != max) {
                    // Choose the situation with the smallest number of coins
                    dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[j - coins[i]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == max ? -1 : dp[amount];

        dp[0] = 0  # Initialize the minimum number of coins needed when the knapsack capacity is 0 to 0

        for coin in coins:  # Iterate over the coin list, equivalent to iterating over items
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):  # Iterate over the knapsack capacity
                if dp[i - coin] != float('inf'):  # If dp[i - coin] is not the initial value, perform state transition
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i - coin] + 1, dp[i])  # Update the minimum number of coins

        if dp[amount] == float('inf'):  # If the final minimum number of coins for the knapsack capacity is still positive infinity, it indicates no solution
            return -1
        return dp[amount]  # Return the minimum number of coins when the knapsack capacity is amount
```

        for i in range(1, amount + 1):  # Iterate over the knapsack capacity
            for j in range(len(coins)):  # Iterate over the coin list, equivalent to iterating over items
                if i - coins[j] >= 0 and dp[i - coins[j]] != float('inf'):  # If dp[i - coins[j]] is not the initial value, perform state transition
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i - coins[j]] + 1, dp[i])  # Update the minimum number of coins

        if dp[amount] == float('inf'):  # If the final minimum number of coins for the knapsack capacity is still positive infinity, it indicates no solution
            return -1
        return dp[amount]  # Return the minimum number of coins when the knapsack capacity is amount

                # Update the minimum number of coins needed to make amount i
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
