# 860. Lemonade Change

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)

At a lemonade stand, each cup of lemonade costs $5.

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and they pay with bills in the order given by the integer array `bills`.

Each customer buys a single cup of lemonade and pays with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide each customer with the correct change. 

Note that you start with no change in hand.

Return `true` if and only if you can provide every customer with the correct change.

Example 1:
- Input: `[5,5,5,10,20]`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation:
  - The first 3 customers pay with $5, so you take 3 $5 bills.
  - The 4th customer pays with a $10 bill and you return $5.
  - The 5th customer pays with a $20 bill and you return a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
  - Since all customers get correct change, we output `true`.

Example 2:
- Input: `[5,5,10]`
- Output: `true`

Example 3:
- Input: `[10,10]`
- Output: `false`

Example 4:
- Input: `[5,5,10,10,20]`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation:
  - We take two $5 bills from the first two customers.
  - For the next two customers who pay with $10 bills, we return $5.
  - The last customer pays with a $20 bill, but we can't return $15 since we only have two $10 bills.
  - Therefore, not every customer receives correct change, so we return false.

Constraints:

- `0 <= bills.length <= 10000`
- `bills[i]` will be either `5`, `10`, or `20`

## Approach

This was a LeetCode daily challenge some days ago, and it's quite interesting, so let's discuss it.

At first glance, this problem might seem a bit confusing. How can we ensure that we always give the correct change?

**But upon closer inspection, you'll realize that there's not much leeway for making decisions!**

You just need to maintain the counts of three denominations: $5, $10, and $20.

There are three scenarios:

- Scenario 1: The bill is $5, just accept it.
- Scenario 2: The bill is $10, use one $5 to give change.
- Scenario 3: The bill is $20, first try to give change with one $10 and one $5. If that's not possible, give change with three $5 bills.

Now, if you look closely, you'll find that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 have a fixed strategy, and there's not much room for analysis. The uncertainty lies in Scenario 3.

Scenario 3 can actually be solved by a greedy approach.

Why should we prefer to use a $10 bill and a $5 bill when the bill is $20?

**Because the $10 bill can only be used to give change for a $20 bill, while the $5 bill can be used to give change for both $10 and $20 bills. The $5 bill is more versatile!**

Thus, the local optimal solution: When encountering a $20 bill, prioritize using one $10 and one $5 bill. The global optimal solution is to provide correct change for all transactions.

If the local optimal strategies lead to the global optimal result and no counterexamples can be found, then a greedy algorithm might just work!

Here's the C++ code for reference:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        int five = 0, ten = 0, twenty = 0;
        for (int bill : bills) {
            // Scenario 1
            if (bill == 5) five++;
            // Scenario 2
            if (bill == 10) {
                if (five <= 0) return false;
                ten++;
                five--;
            }
            // Scenario 3
            if (bill == 20) {
                // Prefer using one $10 if possible, as $5 can be used more widely for change
                if (five > 0 && ten > 0) {
                    five--;
                    ten--;
                    twenty++; // Actually, this line can be removed since tracking $20 isn't necessary
                } else if (five >= 3) {
                    five -= 3;
                    twenty++; // Similarly, this line can also be omitted
                } else return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

## Summary

At first, this problem might seem really complicated, but after breaking down the logic, you'll find that the solution is actually quite fixed.

This problem can teach you that when facing a problem that seems to lack direction, slow down and analyze each situation thoroughly. Once you have broken it down into specific cases, everything becomes clear.

If you're stuck trying to find a global way to handle change, you might end up getting tangled in the possibilities, making it seem more complex than it actually is.
