# 135. Candy Distribution

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

A teacher wants to distribute candies to children standing in a line. There are N children, and the teacher gives ratings to each child based on their performance.

You need to help the teacher distribute candies according to the following requirements:

* Each child must receive at least 1 candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

How many candies does the teacher need to prepare at the minimum?

Example 1:
* Input: [1,0,2]
* Output: 5
* Explanation: You can distribute 2, 1, 2 candies respectively to these three children.

Example 2:
* Input: [1,2,2]
* Output: 4
* Explanation: You can distribute candies as 1, 2, 1 respectively. The third child only gets 1 candy, which already satisfies the conditions.

## Approach

For this problem, you need to consider one direction first, then the other. For example, first compare each child with their left neighbor, then compare with their right. **If you consider both directions at once, you might miss some edge cases.**

First, determine the case where the child with a higher rating on the right gets more candies (i.e., iterate from left to right).

In this case, the local optimal strategy is: whenever a child on the right has a higher rating than the child on the left, give one more candy to the right child. The global optimal is that children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors.

Local optimal can lead to global optimal.

If `ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]`, then the candies of the `i`th child must be one more than the `i-1`th child, so the greedy choice here is: `candyVec[i] = candyVec[i - 1] + 1`.

Code for the above:

```cpp
// Iterating from left to right
for (int i = 1; i < ratings.size(); i++) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) candyVec[i] = candyVec[i - 1] + 1;
}
```

As illustrated:

Next, determine the case where the child with a higher rating on the left gets more candies (i.e., iterate from right to left).

Some might wonder why you can't iterate from left to right for this part. 

This is because when comparing `rating[5]` with `rating[4]`, you need to use the comparison result between `rating[5]` and `rating[6]`, so you must iterate from right to left.

If iterating from left to right, you can't leverage the comparison result between `rating[5]` and `rating[6]` when comparing `rating[5]` and `rating[4]`. As illustrated:

![Image](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20230202102044.png)

**Thus, to determine the situation where the left child has a higher rating than the right child, you must iterate from right to left!**

If `ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]`, then `candyVec[i]` (the number of candies for the ith child) has two choices: one is `candyVec[i + 1] + 1` (derived from adding one candy to the right child), and the other is `candyVec[i]` (derived from previously considering the case where the right child has a higher rating than the left).

Using a greedy approach again, the local optimal solution is to take the maximum number of candies between `candyVec[i + 1] + 1` and `candyVec[i]`, thus ensuring the ith child gets more candies than both its left and right. The global optimal solution is that children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors.

Local optimal can lead to global optimal.

Thus, take the maximum candy count between `candyVec[i + 1] + 1` and `candyVec[i]`. **Only by taking the maximum can you ensure the ith child's candies exceed both its left and right neighbors'.**

As illustrated:

![135. Candy Distribution](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20201117115658791.png)

The corresponding code:

```cpp
// Iterating from right to left
for (int i = ratings.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
        candyVec[i] = max(candyVec[i], candyVec[i + 1] + 1);
    }
}
```

Complete code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        vector<int> candyVec(ratings.size(), 1);
        // Iterating from left to right
        for (int i = 1; i < ratings.size(); i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) candyVec[i] = candyVec[i - 1] + 1;
        }
        // Iterating from right to left
        for (int i = ratings.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candyVec[i] = max(candyVec[i], candyVec[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }
        // Calculate the result
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < candyVec.size(); i++) result += candyVec[i];
        return result;
    }
};
```

* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

## Summary

This is considered a hard problem on LeetCode, and the challenge lies in the greedy strategy. If you try to consider both local aspects simultaneously, you might end up missing some conditions.

Thus, I used two greedy strategies:

* One from left to right, only considering cases where the child's rating on the right is higher than the one on the left.
* Another from right to left, only considering cases where the child's rating on the left is higher than the one on the right.

This method leads to a global optimal solution, where children with higher ratings get more candies than their neighbors.
