# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

**Old Problem Description**:

Each index of the array is a step, and the i-th step corresponds to a non-negative cost value `cost[i]` (index starting from 0).

Every time you climb a step, you need to pay the corresponding cost. Once paid, you can choose to climb one or two steps.

Find the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor. Initially, you can choose to start from the index 0 or index 1.

Example 1:

* Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
* Output: 15
* Explanation: The minimum cost is to start at cost[1], then take two steps to reach the top, totaling 15.

Example 2:

* Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
* Output: 6
* Explanation: The minimum cost is to start at cost[0], go step by step through those 1s, skipping cost[3], and totaling 6.

Constraints:

* The length of `cost` is in the range [2, 1000].
* `cost[i]` will be an integer, within the range [0, 999].

-----------

Previously, the description of this problem was quite vague. It was unclear whether the first step incurs a cost, the last step is free, or the first step is free and the last step incurs a cost.

LeetCode has since revised the problem description. **New Problem Description**:

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i`-th step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can choose to climb one or two steps.

You can either start from step 0 or step 1. 

Your task is to calculate the minimum cost to reach the top of the staircase.

## Idea

(After LeetCode modified the problem statement, I revised the solution accordingly.)

The modified problem statement now makes it clearer. The statement "You can choose to start from the 0th or 1st step" essentially means that jumping to index 0 or index 1 doesn't incur any cost, but beginning from index 0 or index 1 to jump further does incur the cost.

1. Define the dp array and the meaning of indices

Dynamic programming requires an array to keep track of states. In this problem, a one-dimensional array `dp[i]` is sufficient.

**Definition of `dp[i]`: The minimum cost to reach the i-th step is `dp[i]`.**

**Ensure you have a clear understanding of the `dp` array's definition!**

2. Determine the recursive formula

**There are two ways to reach `dp[i]`: from `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`.**

Jumping to `dp[i]` from `dp[i - 1]` requires a cost of `dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1]`. 

Jumping to `dp[i]` from `dp[i - 2]` requires a cost of `dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]`. 

Which path should we choose to reach `dp[i]`? Naturally, we choose the one with the least cost: `dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])`.

3. Initializing the `dp` array

Looking at the recursive formula, `dp[i]` derives from `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Initializing all the `dp[i]` values is not feasible, so initializing `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` suffices, as the rest follow from these values.

What should `dp[0]` be? According to the definition of the `dp` array, the minimum cost to reach the 0th step is `dp[0]`. Some might think `dp[0]` should be `cost[0]`. For example, if `cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]`, `dp[0]` should be 1.

The clarity of the revised problem statement on LeetCode explains why it's modified. As stated in the new problem, "You can choose to start from index 0 or index 1," reaching the zeroth step is free, but moving upwards from index 0 does incur `cost[0]`.

Therefore, initialize with `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = 0`.

4. Determine the loop order

Finally, with the recursive formula and initialization done, how should we traverse through the costs?

The sequence of traversal in this problem is quite straightforward, and many skip pondering over this step and jump straight to coding.

Since this involves simulating steps and calculating `dp[i]` based on `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, traversing the `cost` array from start to finish will suffice.

> **For slightly more challenging dynamic programming problems, determining the loop order is not always straightforward.**
> For instance, the 0/1 knapsack problem. Many know it involves two for-loops, one iterating over the items and a nested one over the capacity. But why not traverse the capacity with one loop and nest items inside the other? And why reverse the loop while using a one-dimensional array?
> **These aspects are closely linked to loop order. Rest assured, the knapsack problem will be extensively covered later on!**

5. Walk through the `dp` array with examples

Let's simulate the changes in the `dp` array with Example 2: `cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]`.

![Image](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20221026175104.png)

Should you encounter issues with your code, print out the `dp` array and compare with the walkthrough.

The C++ code for the above analysis is:

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        vector<int> dp(cost.size() + 1);
        dp[0] = 0; // Assume the first step is free
        dp[1] = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= cost.size(); i++) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
        }
        return dp[cost.size()];
    }
};
```
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

The space complexity can be optimized because `dp[i]` is derived from the previous two values. Here's the C++ code for that:

```CPP
// Version 2
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int dp0 = 0;
        int dp1 = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= cost.size(); i++) {
            int dpi = min(dp1 + cost[i - 1], dp0 + cost[i - 2]);
            dp0 = dp1; // Record the previous two
            dp1 = dpi;
        }
        return dp1;
    }
};

```

* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

In interviews, producing Version 1 should suffice unless the interviewer specifically asks for space optimization, in which case consider Version 2. Version 2 can be a bit tricky. Version 1 is more straightforward.

## Extension 

For the old LeetCode description, if the first step includes a cost and the last step does not, then the code for it is written like this, which can also pass:

```CPP
// Version 1
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        vector<int> dp(cost.size());
        dp[0] = cost[0]; // Initial step incurs a cost
        dp[1] = cost[1];
        for (int i = 2; i < cost.size(); i++) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + cost[i];
        }
        // The last step can be seen as cost-free, hence taking the minimum of the last two
        return min(dp[cost.size() - 1], dp[cost.size() - 2]);
    }
};
```

Of course, if your understanding of dynamic programming is shallow, then skipping the extra content may prevent confusion.

## Summary

You might notice that this problem is slightly more challenging compared to yesterday's [0070.Climbing Stairs](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0070.climbing-stairs.html) but follows a similar thought process.

From [0509.Fibonacci Number](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0509.fibonacci-number.html) to [0070.Climbing Stairs](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0070.climbing-stairs.html) and now to this problem, do you feel the progressive learning curve?

Whenever I start with a series, I receive feedback saying the problems are too easy and need a challenge, while others mention it's becoming difficult to keep up.

However, each problem is chosen with a purpose. Even simple ones practice methodology, and the difficulty gradually increases, building upon each other.

But I could easily pick a random difficult problem to explain, which saves a lot of effortâ€”no order needed, just based on mood.

The hard part is arranging the problems in the right sequence, progressing step by step, and interconnecting them with a unified methodology, so please follow my pace.

        dp0 = 0  # Initial value, indicating no cost from start
        dp1 = 0  # Initial value, indicating no cost on the first step
        
        for i in range(2, len(cost) + 1):

```

Dynamic Programming (Version 3)

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * len(cost)
        dp[0] = cost[0]  # First step incurs a cost
        dp[1] = cost[1]
        for i in range(2, len(cost)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + cost[i]
        # Final step can be understood as free, so take the minimum of the last two steps
        return min(dp[-1], dp[-2])
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:

```Go
func minCostClimbingStairs(cost []int) int {
	n := len(cost)
	dp := make([]int, n+1)
	dp[0], dp[1] = cost[0], cost[1]
	for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
		if i < n {
			dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]
		} else {
			dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])
