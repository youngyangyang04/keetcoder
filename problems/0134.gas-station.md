# 134. Gas Station

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i + 1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Note:

- The solution is guaranteed to be unique if it exists.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

Example 1:  
Input:
- gas = [1,2,3,4,5]
- cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3  
Explanation:
- Start at station 3, with 4 of gas, then your tank has 0 + 4 = 4 of gas
- Travel to station 4, your tank has 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 of gas
- Travel to station 0, your tank has 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 of gas
- Travel to station 1, your tank has 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 of gas
- Travel to station 2, your tank has 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 of gas
- Travel to station 3, you must consume 5 of gas, which is exactly enough to return to station 3.
- Therefore, 3 is the starting index.

Example 2:  
Input:
- gas = [2,3,4]
- cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1  
Explanation:
You cannot start at station 0 or 1 as you do not have enough gas to reach the next station. Starting at station 2, you get 4 gas, and your tank has 0 + 4 = 4 gas.  
Travel to station 0, your tank has 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 gas.  
Travel to station 1, your tank has 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 gas.  
You cannot return to station 2 since you'll need 4 of gas, but your tank only has 3.  
Thus, it is impossible to travel the circuit in one go no matter how you start.

## Thoughts

### Brute Force Method

The brute force solution is obviously O(n^2), where we try starting from each gas station and simulate the journey around the circuit.

If after completing the loop, if we have not run out of gas midway, and the final gas in the tank is more than or equal to 0, this starting point is valid.

The brute force method requires simulating the loop, and is not easy to code. The key is simulating the entire circuit.

**The `for` loop is suitable for a linear pass, while the `while` loop is suitable for a circular traverse, utilize `while` wisely!**

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        for (int i = 0; i < cost.size(); i++) {
            int rest = gas[i] - cost[i]; // Track remaining gas
            int index = (i + 1) % cost.size();
            while (rest > 0 && index != i) { // Simulate starting at i for one lap (if rest==0, the solution is not unique)
                rest += gas[index] - cost[index];
                index = (index + 1) % cost.size();
            }
            // If starting at i for one lap, gas remaining >=0, return the starting position
            if (rest >= 0 && index == i) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Greedy Algorithm (Method One)

Let's perform greedy selection globally in the following scenarios:

- Case One: If the total gas is less than the total cost, then it's impossible to complete one circuit regardless of where you start.
- Case Two: Track the remaining gas `rest[i] = gas[i]-cost[i]`, accumulate it from the start to the last station. If there is a point where the cumulative sum never drops below zero, point zero can be the starting point.
- Case Three: If the cumulative minimum value is negative, start from a non-zero point, looking backward to find any station that can offset this negative value, and it will be the starting point.

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int curSum = 0;
        int min = INT_MAX; // Track the smallest gas level in the tank from the start
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            int rest = gas[i] - cost[i];
            curSum += rest;
            if (curSum < min) {
                min = curSum;
            }
        }
        if (curSum < 0) return -1;  // Case 1
        if (min >= 0) return 0;     // Case 2
                                    // Case 3
        for (int i = gas.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int rest = gas[i] - cost[i];
            min += rest;
            if (min >= 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

**In my opinion, this is not exactly a greedy algorithm since it doesn't really find a locally optimal solution but rather considers the global optimum directly, though the approach is clever.**

Despite this, we call this a greedy algorithm because the solution was derived directly from global optimization. This method is still clever and demonstrates a unique perspective, worth considering.

### Greedy Algorithm (Method Two)

Consider another approach: If the total gas minus the total cost is greater than or equal to zero, it is possible to complete a full loop, and the overall remaining gas `rest[i]` sum is non-negative.

Every gas station's surplus `rest[i]` is `gas[i] - cost[i]`.

Starting from i=0, accumulate `rest[i]`, with the sum recorded as `curSum`. As soon as `curSum` is less than zero, none of [0, i] can be the starting point, because this segment will always run out of gas at i, meaning the starting point must begin after i. Then reset curSum to zero.

Illustration:

![](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20230117165628.png)

Why is a start point valid if sum from [0 to i] <0 can be simply set to i+1 forward, as curSum will never go lower than it? If it did, more nodes, aka i, would be reset thus repositioning the starting point to i+1 again.

Is it possible for a point in [0, i] to keep curSum non-negative? Higher partition of [0, i] into sections 1, 2, etc. ensuring each section, for example section 2, keeps curSum >=0.

With `local optimization`: current cumulated `rest[i]` sum `curSum` as soon less than 0 signifies start point at least i+1 as starting [0 to i-1] inevitably ran out fuel as per illustration. `Global optimization`: Find starting point travelling one full circuit.

Local optimum can promote global optimum, let's challenge this with Greedy!

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int curSum = 0;
        int totalSum = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
            curSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            totalSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (curSum < 0) {   // As soon as current accumulation rest[i] and curSum < 0
                start = i + 1;  // Starting position is updated to i+1
                curSum = 0;     // curSum starts from 0
            }
        }
        if (totalSum < 0) return -1; // Implies it's impossible to complete a circuit
        return start;
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

**This approach embodies the real greedy algorithm ethos, as the global optimal solution is deduced through local optima, with a clear absence of counter-examples, making it concluded feasible!**

## Conclusions

Initially proposing a brute force method, the brute force simulation of a loop is quite challenging requiring adept control over `while` usage.

Followed by two greedy algorithm approaches, the first of which I believe involves direct global optimal simulation, a clever idea, intriguing too.

The second greedy method showcases the essence of greedy strategy, where local optimum is transitionally leading to global optimum solution for selecting a starting position.

        }
    }

    // If total is less than 0, the fuel car can never return to the origin. Return -1
    if(totalSum < 0)
        return -1;

    return start;
}
```

### Scala

Brute Force:

```scala
object Solution {
  def canCompleteCircuit(gas: Array[Int], cost: Array[Int]): Int = {
    for (i <- cost.indices) {
      var rest = gas(i) - cost(i)
      var index = (i + 1) % cost.length // index is the next node of i
      while (rest > 0 && i != index) {
        rest += (gas(index) - cost(index))
        index = (index + 1) % cost.length
      }
      if (rest >= 0 && index == i) return i
    }
    -1
  }
}
```

Greedy Algorithm: Method One

```scala
object Solution {
  def canCompleteCircuit(gas: Array[Int], cost: Array[Int]): Int = {
    var curSum = 0
    var min = Int.MaxValue
    for (i <- gas.indices) {
      var rest = gas(i) - cost(i)
      curSum += rest
      min = math.min(min, curSum)
    }
    if (curSum < 0) return -1 // Case 1: total gas is less than total cost, cannot reach destination
    if (min >= 0) return 0 // Case 2: min >= 0, can start from 0 and reach
    // Case 3: if min is negative, search backwards for a station that fills the minimum
    for (i <- gas.length - 1 to 0 by -1) {
      var rest = gas(i) - cost(i)
      min += rest
      if (min >= 0) return i
    }
    -1
  }
}
```

Greedy Algorithm: Method Two

```scala
object Solution {
  def canCompleteCircuit(gas: Array[Int], cost: Array[Int]): Int = {
    var curSum = 0
    var totalSum = 0
    var start = 0
    for (i <- gas.indices) {
      curSum += (gas(i) - cost(i))
      totalSum += (gas(i) - cost(i))
      if (curSum < 0) {
        start = i + 1 // Update starting point
        curSum = 0  // Reset curSum
      }
    }
    if (totalSum < 0) return -1 // Impossible to go full circle
    start
  }
}
```

### C#

```csharp
// Greedy Algorithm, Version Two
public class Solution
{
    public int CanCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost)
    {
        int curSum = 0, totalSum = 0, start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.Length; i++)
        {
            curSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            totalSum += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (curSum < 0)
            {
                start = i + 1;
                curSum = 0;
            }
        }
        if (totalSum < 0) return -1;
        return start;
    }
}
