# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)

Given two words `word1` and `word2`, find the minimum number of steps required to make `word1` and `word2` the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

Example:

- Input: "sea", "eat"
- Output: 2
- Explanation: First step delete 's' from "sea" to get "ea", and then delete 't' from "eat" to get "ea".

## Solution

### Dynamic Programming Approach One

This problem is similar to [0115.Distinct Subsequences](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0115.distinct-subsequences.html), but here we can delete characters from both strings, adding a bit more complexity while keeping the overall idea unchanged.

### Dynamic Programming Approach Two

This problem is also very similar to [1143.Longest Common Subsequence](https://keetcoder.com/problems/1143.longest-common-subsequence.html). We simply need to find the longest common subsequence between the two strings; all characters not part of this subsequence must be deleted. Subtracting the length of the longest common subsequence from the total length of both strings gives the minimum number of steps required for deletion.

### DP Array Definition

1. Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum number of deletion operations needed to make the strings `word1` of length `i` and `word2` of length `j` the same.

2. Recursive Formula
   - If `word1[i-1]` equals `word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];`
   - If `word1[i-1]` is not equal to `word2[j-1]`, we have:
     - Remove `word1[i-1]`: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
     - Remove `word2[j-1]`: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
     - Remove both `word1[i-1]` and `word2[j-1]`: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 2`

   Therefore, the recursive formula in the case where `word1[i-1]` is not equal to `word2[j-1]` is: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1);`

3. DP Array Initialization
   - `dp[i][0] = i` means deleting all `i` characters from word1 to match an empty word2.
   - `dp[0][j] = j` means deleting all `j` characters from word2 to match an empty word1.

4. Traversal Order
   - We process the dp array from top to bottom, left to right, ensuring each `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on its neighbors: top, left, and top-left.

5. Example Walkthrough
   - For `word1 = "sea"` and `word2 = "eat"`, the state of the dp array will be as illustrated:

   ![583.Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210714101750205.png)

The solution in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(word1.size() + 1, vector<int>(word2.size() + 1));
        for (int i = 0; i <= word1.size(); i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 0; j <= word2.size(); j++) dp[0][j] = j;
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= word2.size(); j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[word1.size()][word2.size()];
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n * m)
- Space Complexity: O(n * m)

The approach in Java is as follows:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[word1.length() + 1][word2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < word1.length() + 1; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 0; j < word2.length() + 1; j++) dp[0][j] = j;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < word1.length() + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < word2.length() + 1; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[word1.length()][word2.length()];
    }
}
```

The Python implementation is:

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(word2)+1) for _ in range(len(word1)+1)]
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

The Go implementation is:

```go
func minDistance(word1 string, word2 string) int {
  dp := make([][]int, len(word1)+1)
  for i := 0; i < len(dp); i++ {
      dp[i] = make([]int, len(word2)+1)
  }
  for i := 0; i < len(dp); i++ {
      dp[i][0] = i
  }
  for j := 0; j < len(dp[0]); j++ {
      dp[0][j] = j
  }
  for i := 1; i < len(dp); i++ {
      for j := 1; j < len(dp[i]); j++ {
          if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1] {
              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
          } else {
              dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)
          }
      }
  }
  return dp[len(dp)-1][len(dp[0])-1]
}

func min(a, b int) int {
  if a < b {
      return a
  }
  return b
}
```

And in JavaScript:

```javascript
var minDistance = (word1, word2) => {
  let dp = Array.from(new Array(word1.length + 1), () =>
    Array(word2.length + 1).fill(0)
  );
  for (let i = 1; i <= word1.length; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = i;
  }
  for (let j = 1; j <= word2.length; j++) {
    dp[0][j] = j;
  }
  for (let i = 1; i <= word1.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= word2.length; j++) {
      if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.min(
          dp[i - 1][j] + 1,
          dp[i][j - 1] + 1
        );
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[word1.length][word2.length];
};
```

For TypeScript:

```typescript
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
    const length1: number = word1.length,
        length2: number = word2.length;
    const dp: number[][] = new Array(length1 + 1).fill(0)
        .map(_ => new Array(length2 + 1).fill(0));
    for (let i = 0; i <= length1; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = i;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i <= length2; i++) {
        dp[0][i] = i;
    }
    for (let i = 1; i <= length1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= length2; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1, 
                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1
                );
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[length1][length2];
};
```

In Rust:

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn min_distance(word1: String, word2: String) -> i32 {
        let mut dp = vec![vec![0; word2.len() + 1]; word1.len() + 1];
        for i in 0..word1.len() {
            dp[i + 1][0] = i + 1;
        }
        for j in 0..word2.len() {
            dp[0][j + 1] = j + 1;
        }
        for (i, char1) in word1.chars().enumerate() {
            for (j, char2) in word2.chars().enumerate() {
                if char1 == char2 {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j + 1].min(dp[i + 1][j]) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        dp[word1.len()][word2.len()] as i32
    }
}
