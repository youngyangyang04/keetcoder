# 141. Linked List Cycle

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/submissions/)

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the list where the tail connects back into. If `pos` is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter, it is only there to represent the actual situation of the linked list.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Approach

You can use the fast and slow pointer technique. Define both `fast` and `slow` pointers that start from the head node. The `fast` pointer moves forward by two nodes each step, while the `slow` pointer moves forward by one node each step. If there is a cycle, the `fast` and `slow` pointers will meet at some point within the cycle.

Why do the fast and slow pointers meet within the cycle, instead of missing each other indefinitely?

Firstly, the `fast` pointer will definitely enter the cycle first. If the `fast` and `slow` pointers meet, it will certainly be within the cycle, which is undeniable.

So, why do the `fast` and `slow` pointers definitely meet?

You can draw a cycle and start the `fast` pointer at any node to chase the `slow` pointer. You will find that eventually, they converge as shown below:

After both the `fast` and `slow` pointers take one more step, they meet.

This is because the fast pointer moves two nodes while the slow pointer moves one node. **Relative to the `slow` pointer, the `fast` pointer is closing in one node at a time**, so they will inevitably coincide.

Here is the animation:

The C++ code is as follows:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            // If fast and slow pointers meet, there is a cycle
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Further Exploration

After solving this problem, you can try [Linked List Cycle II](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0142.%E7%8E%AF%E5%BD%A2%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8II.html), which not only requires finding the cycle but also locating the cycle's entry point.

## Other Language Versions

### Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        // A null list or a single node list will definitely not have a cycle
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next; // Fast pointer, moving two steps at a time
            slow = slow.next;      // Slow pointer, moving one step at a time
            if (fast == slow) {    // If fast and slow pointers meet, there is a cycle
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false; // Reached the end of the list normally, indicating no cycle
    }
}
```

### Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head: return False
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if fast == slow:
                return True
        return False
```

### Go:

```go
func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
    if head==nil{
        return false
    } // an empty list will definitely not have a cycle
    fast := head
    slow := head // Fast and slow pointers
    for fast.Next!=nil && fast.Next.Next!=nil {
        fast = fast.Next.Next
        slow = slow.Next
        if fast == slow {
            return true  // If fast and slow pointers meet, there is a cycle
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

### JavaScript:

```js
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;
    // A null list or a single node list will definitely not have a cycle
    while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
        fast = fast.next.next; // Fast pointer, moving two steps at a time
        slow = slow.next; // Slow pointer, moving one step at a time
        if(fast === slow) return true; // If fast and slow pointers meet, there is a cycle
    }
    return false; // Reached the end of the list normally, indicating no cycle
};
```

### TypeScript:

```typescript
function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
    let slowNode: ListNode | null = head,
        fastNode: ListNode | null = head;
    while (fastNode !== null && fastNode.next !== null) {
        slowNode = slowNode!.next;
        fastNode = fastNode.next.next;
        if (slowNode === fastNode) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```
