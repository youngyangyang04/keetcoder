# 142. Linked List Cycle II

[LeetCode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

Problem Statement:
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If `pos` is -1, then there is no cycle in the link list.

**Note**: Do not modify the linked list.

## Approach

This problem tests both linked list manipulation and some mathematical reasoning.

The main concepts being tested are:

- Determining if a linked list has a cycle
- If a cycle exists, finding the entry point of the cycle

### Determining if a Linked List has a Cycle

You can use the fast and slow pointer method by defining `fast` and `slow` pointers. Start both from the head node, with `fast` moving two steps at a time and `slow` moving one. If there is a cycle, `fast` and `slow` will eventually meet inside the cycle.

Why do `fast` and `slow` pointers meet in the cycle and not miss each other indefinitely?

First, point out: **The `fast` pointer will definitely enter the cycle first, and if `fast` and `slow` meet, it must be inside the cycle.**

Then explain: **Why will `fast` and `slow` definitely meet inside the cycle?**

Visualize any cycle where the `fast` pointer starts to chase the `slow` pointer. Ultimately, this results in the following scenario:

![142 Cycle Linked List 1](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20210318162236720.png)

When `fast` and `slow` both move one more step each, they meet.

This happens because, relative to the `slow`, the `fast` is moving one node closer each time, ensuring it eventually overlaps with `slow`.

The animation is as follows:

![141. Cycle Linked List](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/141.%E7%8E%AF%E5%BD%A2%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8.gif)

### Finding the Entry Point of the Cycle

**Once you determine there is a cycle, the next step is finding where the cycle begins.**

Assume the number of nodes from the head to the cycle entry node is `x`. The number of nodes from the cycle entry node to the meeting point of fast and slow is `y`. Let the number of nodes from the meeting point back to the cycle entry node be `z`. As shown:

![](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/20220925103433.png)

When `fast` and `slow` meet:
The number of nodes `slow` has traveled: `x + y`,
The number of nodes `fast` has traveled: `x + y + n(y + z)`, where `n` is the number of cycles `fast` has completed before meeting `slow`, and `y+z` is the number of nodes per cycle.

Since `fast` moves two steps for every step `slow` moves, thus: 
`(x + y) * 2 = x + y + n(y + z)`

Cancel out one `(x + y)` from both sides:
`x + y = n(y + z)`

To find `x` (the distance from the head to the cycle's entry point), isolate `x`: 
`x = n(y + z) - y`

Factor out an `(y + z)` from `n(y + z)` and rearrange:
`x = (n - 1)(y + z) + z`
Note here, `n` is at least 1, since `fast` must complete at least one full cycle before catching up with `slow`.

This indicates that **starting a pointer from the head and another from the meeting point, both walking one node at a time, will lead them to meet at the entry point of the cycle.**

Thus, define a pointer `index1` at the meeting point, and another pointer `index2` at the head.

Let `index1` and `index2` move simultaneously, one node at a time. Their meeting point will be the node where the cycle starts.

The animation is as follows:

![142. Linked List Cycle II (Finding Entry)](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/142.%E7%8E%AF%E5%BD%A2%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8II%EF%BC%88%E6%B1%82%E5%85%A5%E5%8F%A3%EF%BC%89.gif)

Now, if `n` is more than 1, it means `fast` has completed `n` laps in the circle before catching up with `slow`. However, this method still works in all situations, as `index1` only traverses `(n-1)` additional cycles before meeting `index2`, which will be at the cycle start.

The code is as follows:

```CPP
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            // When fast and slow pointers meet, start searching from head and the meeting point
            if (slow == fast) {
                ListNode* index1 = fast;
                ListNode* index2 = head;
                while (index1 != index2) {
                    index1 = index1->next;
                    index2 = index2->next;
                }
                return index2; // Return cycle entry point
            }
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n), as the number of steps before the fast and slow pointers meet is less than the list length, and additional steps taken by `index1` and `index2` are also less than the list length, summing up to less than `2n`.
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### Supplement

During the process, you might wonder: **Why, upon first meeting inside the cycle, is the number of steps `slow` has moved just `x + y` instead of `x + some full cycles + y`?**

Refer to the article [Linked List: Finding the Cycle, Now Where’s the Entry?](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0142.linked-list-cycle-ii.html) for more clarity on the following:

Assume when the `slow` enters the cycle, `fast` is already in the cycle.

If both `slow` and `fast` start together at the cycle entry, imagine the cycle as a straight line:

![142 Cycle Linked List 3](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/2021031816503266.png)

It's evident that `slow` and `fast` meet at the entry point 3, with `slow` having traversed one cycle and `fast` two cycles.

Now here's the key: Fast is somewhere in the cycle when slow begins, as shown:

![142 Cycle Linked List 4](https://file1.kamacoder.com/i/algo/2021031816515727.png)

Then by the time fast reaches entry 3, it has already covered `k + n steps. Slow, subsequently, has covered `(k + n) / 2` steps.

Given `k < n` (as visualized), `(k + n) / 2` is always less than `n`.

**This implies `slow` must intersect with `fast` during this initial cycle.**

And why can’t `fast` skip over `slow`? As clarified earlier, **relative to `slow`, `fast` moves towards `slow` one step at a time, so it cannot skip over.**

This fully explains why `slow`'s steps add up to `x + y` and not `x + several full cycles + y`, complementing [Linked List: Finding the Cycle, Now Where’s the Entry?](https://keetcoder.com/problems/0142.linked-list-cycle-ii.html).
